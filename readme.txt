Improving Caption - Improving up the WP [caption] shortcode.

== Description ==

WordPress adds an inline style to its [caption] shortcode which specifically adds 10px of extra width to captions. This extra width makes the assumption that all captions should have 10px of extra padding to account for a box that wraps the element.

This plugin changes the width to match that of the 'width' attribute passed in through the shortcode, allowing themes to better handle how their captions are designed.

No configuration required.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the improving-caption.zip folder
1. Upload the improving-caption folder to your /wp-content/plugins directory
1. In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the Plugins section
1. Activate Improving Caption
